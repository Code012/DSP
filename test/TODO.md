THINGS TO DO:

-Reference Thorsten
- Go through Crafting Interpreters and implement things you could, and structure code like he does because he uses java.
        = Add what character the error is on, this is in crafitng interpretess
        = go through this bok and add anything new
- Add the correct terminology in your code. e.g. for the pratt parsers (led, nud, etc), for lexer (lexemes etc)
-When writing report, use Crafting Interpreters for talking about lexer theory, and Thorsten for pratt aprser.
- Implement visitor pattern to AST for eval stage and also for printing (which you do inside the class right now) look at Crafting Interpreters for this
